Interesting content:
  Good levels of information. The reader is not overloaded with information.

Good consistent visual presentation:
  Well balanced with pictures and videos.
  Would be nice if the reference links were hidden behind text or on a seperate page. Feel like the reference pane takes up too much of the page.

Good written presentation:
  Content is educational and interesting. Using diagrams to help explain whats happening


Valid HTML:
Very well structured HTML. potentially copied source code?

Balanced contributions from members:
Can't tell


Not completed at the last minute:
Too well structured to be done last minute
